                <p style="text-align: justify ; font-size: 20px;">Matugama  is a semi urban town surrounded by mountains. It is an electorate of the Kalutara district, in Western Province, Sri Lanka. The town is located 64 km to the south of Colombo. Matugama is also spelled as Mathugama.Matugama is part of the Pasdun Korale ('County of the five yojanas'), created when King Parakramabahu the Great drained the Kalu Ganga basin. In the days of the State Council it comprised the present-day Agalawatte, Bulathsinhala and Matugama constituencies. In 1946, it was divided into two, the eastern portion becoming Agalawatte (itself subdivided in 1960 by the creation of Bulathsinhala).

                    Since 1989 it has been an electoral division of the Kalutara District, not a constituency sending a member to parliament in its own right.Matugama is easily accessible via the Southern Expressway (Sri Lanka). The town is located about 10 km eastward to the Dodangoda Interchange. There are two access roads from Colombo-Galle main road at Katukurunda (in Kalutara) and Aluthgama. Matugama is also accessible via Horana or Agalawatte.</p>

The Constitution of Sri Lanka provides free education as a fundamental right. Sri Lanka's population had an adult literacy rate of 96.3% in 2015, which is above average by world and regional standards.[note 1] Education plays a major part in the life and culture of the country and dates back to 543 BC. Sri Lanka's modern educational system was brought about by its integration into the British Empire in the 19th century. Education currently falls under the control of both the Central Government and the Provincial Councils, with some responsibilities lying with the Central Government and the Provincial Council having autonomy for others</p>

                            Diagrammatic section across Sri Lanka as per D. N. Wadia
                            Sri Lanka was once part of the southern supercontinent Gondwana, which also included South America, Africa, India and Antarctica. Gondwana began to break up 140 million years ago. The tectonic plate on which Sri Lanka was located, the Indian plate, collided with the Eurasian plate creating the Himalayas.

                            Sri Lanka was originally part of the Deccan land mass, contiguous with Madagascar. The island was connected, off and on at least 17 times in the past 700,000 years, to India.</p>

                    <p style="text-align: justify ; font-size: 18px;">&#34;Sri Lanka is an island that everyone loves at some level inside themselves. A very special island that travellers, from Sinbad to Marco Polo, dreamed about. A place where the contours of the land itself forms a kind of sinewy poetry.
